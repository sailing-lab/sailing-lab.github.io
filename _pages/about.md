Welcome to the SAILING! SAILING is a research laboratory created in 2004, and is headed by Professor Eric Xing. We are primarily based at Carnegie Mellon University and Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence.

**Research synopsis**: Our principal research interests lie in the development of machine learning and statistical methodology, and large-scale computational system and architecture, for solving problems involving automated learning, reasoning, and decision-making in high-dimensional, multimodal, and dynamic possible worlds in artificial, biological, and social systems.
